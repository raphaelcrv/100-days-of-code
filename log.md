# 100 Days Of Code - Raphael Log

### Day 0: Octuber 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I done one exercise from freeCodeCamp, and today i joined in the game on this challenge!

**Thoughts:** doing that exercise, i learned about browser compatibility and variables with css. I don't knew it that was possible moreover i'm practicing english doing that.
